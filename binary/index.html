    <h2>Counting with Binary</h2>
    <div class='border'>
        <div class='text'>
            <p> Binary can be used for counting numbers. <br>Numbers are data, so they can be conveyed in binary. Let's take a random number, 9. <br>In binary, each number in a binary sequence corresponds to a place value. </p>
        </div>
        <img src="https://images.spiritualsworld.xyz/r/DQODFo.png" class="centerd binaryexample" id='terminal'>
        <div class='text'>
            <p> 4 numbers, 4 bits. The more bits, the more possible combinations of <br>numbers, and the more complex the operations. For our number, four numbers or bits is enough.<br> To create the number six in binary, you would have to add up the place values to get six. </p>
        </div>
        <div class='gianttext'>
            <b>8</b> + <b>1</b> = <b>9</b>
        </div>
        <div class='text'>
            <b>in other words...</b>
        </div>
        <div class='gianttext'>
            <b>1001</b>
        </div>
        <div class='text'> It's that easy! (...not really it took me three days to grasp it) </div>
    </div>

    <h2>ASCII</h2>
    <div class='border'>
        <div class='text'>
            <p> Binary can also be used to spell words. Binary can be converted to ASCII, which is a format for text data. Each letter corresponds to a number in ASCII, and you can convert the ASCII numbers to binary. </p>
            <img src="http://images.spiritualsworld.xyz/u/‌‌‌‌⁠​" class="centerd lol">
            <div class='text'>
                <p> Let's take for example, the word <b>APACHE</b> (a.k.a. the best server software.) </p>
            </div>
            <img src='http://images.spiritualsworld.xyz/u/Jmns03.jpeg' id='frusterating' class='centerd'>
            <div class='text'>
                <p> First, we would take the letters of the word <b>APACHE</b> and convert those into ASCII. <br>We then convert the ASCII numbers into binary, and we're done! <br>We wrote words in binary using ASCII and a little conversion. </p>

    <h2>Images</h2>
    <div class='border'>
        <div id='imagemaking' class='text'>
            <p> Oddly enough, Binary can also be used to make images. <br>Everything that you see on the screen is the result of many pixels each with their own color. <br>The color that each pixel is depends on its RGB value, or red green blue value. <br>This value determines how red, green, or blue something is on the screen. <br>Try hovering over this image to see what happens to a pixel as an image is being made on the screen. </p>
        </div>
        <img src="https://vip-go.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/06/RGB-Profile-Color-Wheel.jpg" class="rgbexample stupid">
        <div class='text'>
            <p> In the above image, you can see that as you hover over the image (or click if you're on mobile), <br>the image goes from grey to every color you can imagine. <br>The same thing happens for everything that's on your screen! <br>Each pixel starts at black, and becomes a color by using the RGB value to determine its color. <br>Using this method, we can create almost every color the eye can see. </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class='lazyspacing'> . </div>
    <h2>Hexadecimal and Binary</h2>
    <div class='border'>
        <div class='text'>
            <p> Hexadecimal is a base 16 numbering system. <br>Hexadecimal was designed to be a way for humans to more <br>easily read the meanings of binary numbers. </p>
        </div>
        <img src='http://images.spiritualsworld.xyz/u/UmCe8T.png' id='bigpic'>
        <div class='text'>
            <p> In the chart above, every number up to 15 can be converted to binary and hexadecimal. <br>You'll also notice that the hexadecimal numbers are much easier to intepret. <br>Instead of having four bit numbers like 0010 or 0111 or whatever string of binary, <br>you can count regularly up to 9, then recall the regular alphabet until 15. <br>It's much easier to remember, and carries the same meaning as a binary string. Neat! </p>
